Despite aggressive treatment, only 40% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma survive beyond five years, due to treatment resistance and relapse.

Our results revealed initial adaptation to treatment occurs through plasticity. Neuroblastoma cells existed within a phenotypic continuum, predominantly residing in three semi-stable states with distinct cellular properties. In response to treatment, plasticity shaped the phenotypic landscape topology and transition dynamics along the continuum steering cells towards fitter states. Plasticity predicted lineage dominance, irrespective of phenotype, with highly plastic cells transitioning into drug-tolerant persister (DTP) states under cisplatin treatment. Following treatment cessation, these lineages unpredictably awakened and repopulated the original phenotypic population composition. Notably, plasticity levels increased in response to treatment. In patient populations, plasticity emerged as a strong predictor of clinical outcomes. Our study refines plasticity as an early driver of treatment adaptation in neuroblastoma, accelerating evolution through non-genetic selection of plasticity rather than the fixation of specific phenotypic traits.
